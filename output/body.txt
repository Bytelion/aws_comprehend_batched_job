The six students from the Frederick area are the first to ever successfully complete every problem in the MAGIC Ethical Hacking Capture the Flag (CTF) Cybersecurity competitions. In addition to celebrating their achievement, we want the teams to make valuable connections with cybersecurity professionals.
 
 MAGIC is pleased to report that the Fourth Capture the Flag (CTF 004) Cybersecurity Competition held on Saturday November 4, 2017 at the Community Media Center in Westminster, MD was a success and established several new milestones for MAGIC programming. A new record was set for total participants, with over 150 students registered across six locations, five Maryland locations and one location in Wilson, NC.  
 
 It’s no secret that Westminster, Maryland is a town rich with historical significance and antique beauty. But have you ever wondered what it may have looked like before the city, like the rest of America, was reshaped by the fast-moving, modern character of the twenty-first century? With MainStAR, or the Main Street Augmented Reality project, we no longer have to wonder.
 
 On Saturday, November 4th, 2017 from 11am-4pm MAGIC will host its 4th Capture the Flag (CTF 004) competition. MAGIC’s CTF 004 is a cybersecurity, ethical hacking competition for entry-level participants. The entire event will be live streamed from the main arena located at the Community Media Center of Carroll County in Westminster, MD. This event is bigger than previous events as multiple remote locations, such as the Imagination Station in Wilson, NC, the C. Burr Artz Library in Frederick, MD, and the Washington County Free Library in Hagerstown, MD.

 For an organization less than a year old (officially), MAGIC has had a very busy year. We are grateful to the many individuals and organizations who've played a role in inaugural year of operations. Here’s a month by month look at what we accomplished in 2016...
 
 A local lawyer, a self-professed non-techie, was visiting a local non-profit in Westminster for a meeting recently.  He was escorted to the conference room by a young manager at the organization, and as they exchanged pleasantries, both realized that they had a connection. 
 
 MAGIC hosted its first fundraising event called Hack and Sip. Guests were treated to a fun-filled evening where they deepened their understanding of tech, wine, and MAGIC.

 If you drive down Rt. 140 toward Reisterstown, you may see a billboard on the right showing the winners of the Chamber of Commerce’s recent Carroll Biz Challenge. Three McDaniel students put together a startup called BookSwap, and theirs is a success story for the future.    
 Small businesses and entrepreneurs are the foundation of a healthy local economy. It’s a common sense idea that has substantial support in economic data. Nurturing a vibrant entrepreneurial culture is one step toward ensuring reliable economic growth.  
 According to the U.S. Small Business administration, small companies employ just over 50% of the workforce, and more importantly, account for 2/3 of net new job growth. This is confirmed by U.S. Census data. It also shows that new small companies have a failure rate of 50% in the first five years, increasing to 70% fail in the first 10 years of operations.
 These numbers have important implications. If most new jobs come from small businesses and start-ups, and half of new businesses fail in the first 5 years, continued job growth requires constant replacement of failed small businesses with new small businesses. That means supporting entrepreneurs and startups should be a very high priority for economic development.
 Where do entrepreneurs come from? Are they born, or can they be made? Once you find an entrepreneur, what are the factors that increase their probability of success?
 The Kauffman Foundation is a non-profit devoted to researching, supporting, and promoting entrepreneurship, and they publish frequent white papers on these very issues. Although far from settled science, one thing is clear: entrepreneurs matter, and efforts to identify, recruit, nurture, and accelerate them can pay huge dividends for a community.
 Locally, a new non-profit called MAGIC (the Mid-Atlantic Gigabit Innovation Collaboratory) conducts programming and projects to foster innovation, recruit and nurture entrepreneurs, and help existing startups increase their growth trajectory.
 The BookSwap team started their journey toward entrepreneurship with MAGIC. Brandon Cortese participated in the first MAGIC Capture the Flag cybersecurity competition. He then recruited two more friends to participate in the MAGIC Hackathon last February, where they learned to design, build and pitch an app over the course of a weekend, with the assistance of MAGIC volunteers.
 “People can bring their creative ideas to life for the world to see with just some lines of code,” said Cortese about the Hackathon experience. The team went through all the hardships and excitement of entrepreneurship, including long hours, loneliness, doubts, as well as camaraderie, inspiration, and confidence.
 “Failure isn't actually failure; instead, it's an opportunity for growth,” said Dajaun Price, another BookSwap team member. This is a valuable lesson difficult to teach without practical experience. The MAGIC events provide exactly that. Price continued, “MAGIC taught us how to be productive, even when unexpected adversity strikes.”
 On their third attempt competing in pitch competitions, the team won 1st place and $7,500 in the Biz Challenge and continue to push toward the commercialization of their app. They have to form a company, file for trademarks, and push hard for the first revenues. Cortese concluded, “I know the road is long and there are so many more steps we need to take.” The team is using their winnings to continue the development of the app and begin marketing efforts on college campuses.
 Now we need to create another 20 new start-ups like BookSwap, and keep doing that every year, forever. It will take many years to get there, and it’s a lot of work, but worth it.

 Westminster, MD – High school and college students with an interest in coding, graphic design, and business will learn to design, build, and pitch an application in a weekend at the Second Annual Carroll County Hackathon. The Hackathon is free and interested students should register as soon as possible. Space is limited, register at www.CarrollCountyHackathon.com.
 The Carroll County Hackathon is jointly sponsored by MAGIC, Bytelion, Carroll Community College, and McDaniel College. This year’s event will be hosted at Carroll Community College. “We at Carroll Community College are delighted co-sponsor and host the Hackathon, which has proven itself to be a very exciting event” said Dr. James D. Ball, president of Carroll Community College. “The local coding and app-building momentum that as resulted from this activity continues to snowball. It’s exhilarating to see students of all ages come together to showcase their imagination, creativity and coding prowess.”
 The hackathon commences with a workshop developed by Bytelion on Saturday, February 17, 2018 in the Bollinger Family Conference Center room K100 at Carroll Community College. While students can work on any type of application, Bytelion, a technology company located in Carroll County Maryland, is developing the hackathon to focus on the intricacies of cryptocurrencies, including software generation, distributed computing, and the economics of cryptocurrency exchanges. “Carroll County has the talent and the drive to not only operate, but to compete on the world stage in this space,” said Terry MacGregor, CEO at Bytelion.
 The following weekend, Friday, February 23 through Sunday, February 25, 2018, teams of students will gather in the K Building at Carroll Community College to work on their projects. Tech and entrepreneur experts will be volunteering all weekend to help students perfect their applications. “The Carroll County Hackathon is a terrific opportunity for up and coming developers to work alongside seasoned professionals while displaying their creativity and vision using innovative technologies,” said Andy McCallum, CTO at Bytelion.
 The weekend concludes with presentations on Sunday, February 25, 2018 from 2-5pm. Students will pitch and demo their applications to judges in the Bollinger Family Conference Center room K100. Parents and community members are encouraged to attend to see what the students have created!
 “Community events such as the Hackathon, along with the rapidly increasing need for coding skills by local and regional businesses, led Carroll Community College to implement a new app development training program for the iOS platform,” stated Chet Andes, Coordinator of IT and Workforce Development. “Our ten-week Swift program was designed specifically to fit the needs of busy high school and college students as well as working adults. We hope to see many of the Hackathon participants register for this new program to help them prepare for a career they’re obviously passionate about.”
 2017 Winning Team
 Participants from last year’s Carroll County Hackathon were placed into internships and part-time and full-time jobs as a result of their performance during the hackathon. "One of the things I enjoy most about the Hackathon," says Josh Ambrose, Executive Director of the Center for Experience and Opportunity at McDaniel College, "is that it has already helped several of our students place into internships, part-time work, and even full-time employment. I'm excited to see participation numbers rise as more students, from more locations, engage in a weekend that truly can change lives."

 A local lawyer, a self-professed non-techie, was visiting a local non-profit in Westminster for a meeting recently.  He was escorted to the conference room by a young manager at the organization, and as they exchanged pleasantries, both realized that they had a connection. 
 “We’ve met, haven’t we?” asked the lawyer.  The young manager responded, “Were you at Hack & Sip?”
 Indeed, both had been at the MAGIC Hack & Sip event a few weeks before, sipping wine and learning about cybersecurity in the Ting Makerspace in downtown Westminster.  Hack & Sip was the first of many MAGIC events aimed at gradually building the technology entrepreneur ecosystem by exposing wider and wider circles of community leaders, opinion makers, and people interested in transforming the local economy to the economic development potential of broadband infrastructure and  the importance of tech innovation for job growth.
 A thriving tech entrepreneurial ecosystem is fundamentally a social network, and social networks require connections between people, even those who aren’t directly involved in technology.  The wider the connections, the greater the probability of successful collaborations and the serendipity of innovation meeting problem, combined with market demand, leading to economic growth.

 It’s no secret that Westminster, Maryland is a town rich with historical significance and antique beauty. But have you ever wondered what it may have looked like before the city, like the rest of America, was reshaped by the fast-moving, modern character of the twenty-first century? With MainStAR, or the Main Street Augmented Reality project, we no longer have to wonder.
